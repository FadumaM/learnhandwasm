# 01. Your first WASM Module

Without further ado, here is the first WASM module we will be looking at:

```webassembly
(module $arithmetic
  (func $i32.add (export "i32.add")
    (param $a i32)
    (param $b i32)
    (result i32)
    (i32.add
      (get_local $a)
      (get_local $b))))
```

In this workshop we will be working with the S-expression based WebAssembly
Text-Format (WAT), which at first will seem foreign to Javascript developers
but quickly will become familiar.

The above module is the "hello world" of WebAssembly. Before we start writing
WAT ourselves we need to learn a bit about the syntax and grammar of WAT. You
should paste the module into a file so we can play around with it. I will be
calling mine for `arithmetic.wat`.

The first thing we notice is the `(module $arithmetic)` instruction.
`$arithmetic` is a label that the compiler will be turning into a simple
integer that will count up. In WASM you can (at present) have a single module
per file, and the name is only for debugging, as it will be replaced with said
integer. However `wat2wasm` can extract labels and place them into a special
debugging section, like source maps from Javascript, so they can be consumed
by disassemblers and debuggers.

Try running the following command:

```
echo '(module $arithmetic)' | wat2wasm --dump-module -
```

What it does is that it compiles the module from `stdin` and prints the
annotated byte-code. As you can see it's is not very interesting, simply
printing a `\0` byte, the ASCII string `asm` and then a version identifier.

Now try with the following command:

```
echo '(module $arithmetic)' | wat2wasm --dump-module --debug-names -
```

You can see a lot more information has been added to the binary module.
In particular notice line `0000012` with our name `arithmetic` encoded.
During the workshop it is recommended to always append the `--debug-names`
flag, when compiling your modules. However, for production it is recommended
to not add these symbols, as they can incur a significant increase in module
size, just like you wouldn't ship source maps to production.

A bit of a nitty gritty detour, but head on to the next exercise where we will
look at `$i32.add` function:
